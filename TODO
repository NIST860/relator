RESULTS EMISSION DATA IS FOR PERIOD 10 FOR ALMOST ALL DATA
we rely upon the fact that BlanketWall and RigidWall have identical Rates


Refactors:
	stop hard-coding the id of emissiontype Carbon in results/carbon
	emissions.emissions/impacts/normalized -> OrderedDict
	rename carbon to emissions
	rename Equivalence (emission -> type, equivalence -> value)
	maintenace_cost, repair_cost, replace_cost, ?_cost_for
	energy use -> energy use per year

Security holes:
	input fields are sometimes used in the form Quantity(#, input)
		(If such fields are exposed to non-admin, that's bad.)

Notes:
	We assume that R-value increases with insulation price
	We assume that cooling is the first capacity given in eplus files
	We assume that frame > film > coating when ordering windows by 'cost'

When you're bored:
	ensure import consistency
	move __unicode__ up to under __meta__
	Convert all names to lowercase (they're .title()'d in __unicode__)
	Think of a better way to use output scripts

For the future:
	rework filtering in views (use POST?)
	results -> database
